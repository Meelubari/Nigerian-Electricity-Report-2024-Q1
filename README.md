###

<h1 align="left">Overview</h1>

###

<p align="left">This analysis aims to provide a high-level overview  of Nigeria's electricity sector performance in Q1 2024, by tracking energy billed, revenue generated, and customer distribution across different electricity distribution companies(Discos).</p>

###

<h1 align="left">Why This Project Is Useful.</h1>

###

<p align="left">This project is useful because it transforms raw electricity sector data into actionable insights for decision makers. <br><br>This project helps stakeholders:<br><br>Monitor performance at the Disco level.<br>Segment customers ( Metered and postpaid) <br>Visual comparison of regional performance. <br>With policy and regulation support (FG, NERC, NBS can track its reforms).<br>Make an Operational decision, Eg, identify high-revenue Vs low-revenue regions</p>

###

<h1 align="left">Key Findings</h1>

###

<ul>
  <li><b>Revenue is growing strongly:</b> â‚¦291.62B in Q1 (+17.91% YoY). Despite a slight decline in energy billed, revenue is up, possibly due to tariff adjustments or improved collections.</li>
  <li><b>Energy billed is declining slightly:</b> 5.77k Gwh (-1.41% YoY). Growth is driven by pricing or billing efficiency, not higher energy supply.</li>
  <li><b>Customer base is expanding:</b> +9.47% YoY, showing continued sector growth.</li>
  <li><b>Metering is improving, but postpaid dominates:</b> 5.91M customers metered (+11.26% YoY), yet 52% remain on postpaid billing.</li>
  <li><b>Distribution company performance is uneven:</b> IBEDC leads with 2.5M customers, followed by AEDC (1.5M). Smaller DisCos lag.</li>
  <li><b>Regional disparities in electricity access:</b> Concentration of electricity is highest in the Southwest and North-Central regions.</li>
  <li><b>Sector priorities must balance growth with supply:</b> Revenue growth is positive, but sustainability requires boosting supply and accelerating metering coverage.</li>
</ul>



###

<h1 align="left">Recommendations</h1>

###

<ul>
  <li><b>Investigate if tariff adjustments, improved collection efficiency, or reduced losses drove the revenue growth despite lower energy.</b></li>
  <li><b>
    DISCOs should focus on reducing technical and commercial losses to sustain growth without over-relying on tariff hikes.
  </b></li>
  <li><b>
    Accelerate meter rollout, especially for high-consuming customers,  to reduce estimated billing complaints and revenue leakages.
  </b></li>
<li><b>
  Implement targeted meter deployment in DISCOs with the highest unmetered population (e.g., PHEDC, KEDC).
</b></li>
<li><b>
  Transition more customers from postpaid to prepaid to enhance billing transparency and cash flow.
</b></li>
<li><b>
  Offer incentives (e.g., discounts / Free metering, faster service response) to encourage prepaid adoption.
</b></li>
<li><b>
  Regulatory authorities (NERC) should ensure tariffs remain fair and linked to improved service delivery.
</b></li>
<li><b>
  Encourage performance-based regulation for DISCOs to align incentives with customer satisfaction.
</b></li>
  
</ul>

<h1 align="left">Final Thought</h1>

###

<p align = "left">
The Nigeria Electricity Report Q1 2024 highlights a mixed performance in the sector. On one hand, revenue growth is strong (+17.91% YoY), signaling improvements in tariff adjustments and revenue collection. On the other hand, energy billed declined (-1.41% YoY), suggesting persistent challenges with supply capacity, energy losses, and inefficiencies.

The growing customer base (+9.47% YoY) shows rising demand, but the sector must address the imbalance between postpaid (52%) and metered customers (48%) to reduce revenue leakages and improve billing accuracy. DISCOs, such as IBEDC and AEDC, are driving customer volume, while smaller ones lag, indicating regional disparities in access and distribution.

Overall, the sector is moving in a positive financial direction; however, sustainability depends on addressing structural issues, including expanding metering coverage, improving energy distribution efficiency, and enhancing customer engagement. With targeted investments and policy reforms, Nigeria can build a more reliable, equitable, and efficient electricity market.
