###

<h1 align="left">Why This Project Is Useful.</h1>

###

<p align="left">This project is useful because it transforms raw electricity sector data into actionable insights for decision makers. <br><br>This project helps stakeholders:<br><br>Monitor performance at the Disco level.<br>Segment customers ( Metered and postpaid) <br>Visual comparison of regional performance. <br>With policy and regulation support (FG, NERC, NBS can track its reforms).<br>Make an Operational decision, Eg, identify high-revenue Vs low-revenue regions</p>

<h1 align="left">Key Findings</h1>

###

<p align="left"><b>Key Findings – Nigeria Electricity Report Q1 2024</b></p>
<ul>
  <li><b>Revenue is growing strongly:</b> ₦291.62B in Q1 (+17.91% YoY). Despite a slight decline in energy billed, revenue is up, possibly due to tariff adjustments or improved collections.</li>
  <li><b>Energy billed is declining slightly:</b> 5.77k Gwh (-1.41% YoY). Growth is driven by pricing or billing efficiency, not higher energy supply.</li>
  <li><b>Customer base is expanding:</b> +9.47% YoY, showing continued sector growth.</li>
  <li><b>Metering is improving, but postpaid dominates:</b> 5.91M customers metered (+11.26% YoY), yet 52% remain on postpaid billing.</li>
  <li><b>Distribution company performance is uneven:</b> IBEDC leads with 2.5M customers, followed by AEDC (1.5M). Smaller DisCos lag behind.</li>
  <li><b>Regional disparities in electricity access:</b> Concentration of electricity is highest in the Southwest and North-Central regions.</li>
  <li><b>Sector priorities must balance growth with supply:</b> Revenue growth is positive, but sustainability requires boosting supply and accelerating metering coverage.</li>
</ul>
